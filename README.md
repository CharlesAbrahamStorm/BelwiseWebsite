# BelWise — Static Prototype

This is a simple static prototype of the BelWise technology company webpage built to match the provided template and requirements.

Tech stack
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (CDN for quick prototype)
- Minimal JavaScript for smooth scrolling and mobile toggle

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `assets/illustration.png` — placeholder illustration used in the hero
- `assets/about-photo.jpg` — placeholder about image

How to open
1. Open `c:/xampp/htdocs/Belwise/index.html` in your browser.
2. Or, if you have PHP/XAMPP running, place the folder in your web root and visit `http://localhost/BelWise/`.

Notes & next steps
- Replace placeholder images with the final artwork from the PDF if preferred.
- I used Tailwind via CDN for quick setup. If you want a build process (npm + Tailwind CLI), I can add it.
- I can also split the page into components and add a responsive mobile navigation drawer if desired.

If you'd like changes (colors, fonts, copy, or extra pages), tell me which items to update and I'll apply them.
